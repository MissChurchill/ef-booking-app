import math

#start by asking user to input number of travelers
reservation_number=int(input("How many travelers need hotel rooms?"))

#if the input is 0 or less/a negativer number then we would account for it by returning no rooms needed 
if reservation_number <= 0:
    print("No rooms needed")
#for all other numbers greater than 0 and not negative we will print the results for each room type by dividing the number of travelers by the room capacity
#quads with a capacity of 4, triples with a capacity of 3, doubles with a capacity of 2, and singles with a capacity of 1    
elif reservation_number > 0:
    print((reservation_number/4), 'quad rooms')
    print((reservation_number/3), 'triple rooms')
    print((reservation_number/2), 'double rooms')
    print((reservation_number/1), 'single rooms')

#How to read results
#if the result is a float such as 33.333333333333336 or 12.5 then we know we have to do some additional math
#We would simply take the result and multipy it by the room capacity then subtract that number from the number of travelers
#the remainder number will tell us how many additional travelers need rooms and we can put that in the formula to tell us which room type    
#or another way to read if there is a remainder is as follows
#if it is 502.5 that is 502 doubles and 1 single because .5 of a double is a single room
#if it is 33.333333333333336 triple rooms that is 33 triples and 1 single room that is because anything over a whole number will translate to single rooms
#if is 12.5 quads that is 12 quads and 1 double because .5 of a quad is a double
